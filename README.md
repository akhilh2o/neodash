# Introduction to Neodash

**Neodash** is a admin panel package made for laravel on top of *Laravel Breeze*. It is a very simple setup for a quick start, with a separate admin panel having user, roles & permissions,  posts, pages, faqs and testimonials management. This package uses Bootstrap 4.x. 

## Installation
Update your *.env* file, provide database name, user and password. Execute command given below to install **neodash admin panel**

    composer require akhilesh/neodash

Run following command to quick installation

    php artisan neodash:install fresh

By default default scaffold will be generated with default options, instead you can change your setting in configuration file `site.php` and run `php artisan neodash:install` once again. This will ask some questions like, if you want to migrate the fresh table or not, or you want to seed the tables or not.

After installation you will get routes in admin.php file in routes folder, models and controller with their related trait and views. To override the properties / functionalities, define your own respective function in controller. This package comes with a route middleware `GatesMiddleware::class`, admin routes will be wrapped within this middleware.

### Configurations
Add `ASSET_URL` to *.env* file, which will point to pubic directory. 
public/assets: In this folder you will get all the static images, css, js and other files.

A `storage()` helper will be provided to get the url of publically stored images. If you want to change this url, you can set a property in *.env* file `STORAGE_URL`.

You can disable *install command* from *config/site.php* by setting *command* key to false. This will protect you by running the command file accidentally and replacing your existing files.

## Extra functionalities

- **ReferrerMiddleware middleware:**  This middleware can be used to redirect from specific route to some other route. Both routes (form, to) should be passed in the route, eg. 

        route(
            'some.route', 
            [
                'refer' => [
                    // specify the route from where the application will be redirected
                    'refer_from'    => route('redirect.source'), 

                    // specify the destination route where to be redirected back
                    'refer_to'      => route('redirect.destination'),

                    // optional (checking the request method along with 'refer_from')
                    'method'        => 'GET' 
                ]
            ]
        );


**For Example:**
    
        route('some.route',  [ 
            'refer' => [ 
                'refer_from' => route('redirect.source'), 
                'refer_to' => route('redirect.destination'), 
                'method' => 'GET' 
            ]
